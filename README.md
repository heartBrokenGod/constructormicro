# constructormicro

## Core Principles

Service code generated by constructormicro should be:

1. [ ] Correct
2. [ ] Performant
3. [ ] Maintainable


## The Rules

Service generated by constructormicro:

1. [ ]  Should follow [12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/)

   1.  [ ]  Service codebase tracked as [git](https://git-scm.com/) repository
   2.  [ ]  Service codebase dependencies should be declarred in language specific dependency management system eg: [Go Dependency Management](https://go.dev/doc/modules/managing-dependencies)
   3. [ ]  Service runtime instance should be configurable through environment variables
   4. [ ]  Service makes no distinction between local and third party services
   5. [ ]  Service uses strict separation between `build`, `release` and `run` stages
   6. [ ]  Service runtime instance processes are stateless and share nothing
   7. [ ]  Service exports its functionality via port binding
   8. [ ]  Service should scale out vertically via process model or language native concurrency eg: [Go Concurrency](https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/11)
   9. [ ]  Service should shut down gracefully when they receive a SIGTERM
   10. [ ]  Service uses same backing service for all deployment envs (local, dev, stg, prd)
   11. [ ]  Service treat logs as event stream and should not concern itself with routing and storing of logs
   12. [ ]  Run admin/management task as one process

2. [ ] Should follow clean code structure
3. [ ] Should be extendable, modifiable by developers but still be supported by contructormicro
4. [ ] Should have a `Version` file
5. [ ] Dependencies should be upgradable by constructormicro
6. [ ] Should have `Makefile`, `Dockerfile` and `example.env` file
7. [ ] Should have Authentication and Authorization with choice (JWT/PASETO)
8. [ ] Should have Tracing
9. [ ] Should have protocol selection choice (REST/GRPC/GrahpQL)
10. [ ] Should have option to add custom request middleware
11. [ ] Should have option to select service type (public/internal) (sync/async)
